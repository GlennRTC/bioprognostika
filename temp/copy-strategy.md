### Personalized Insights Copy

#### Priority Recommendations Format
**Template:**
"üéØ TOP PRIORITY: [Action]
[Explanation of impact and reasoning]

Evidence: [Supporting research citation]"

**Example:**
"üéØ TOP PRIORITY: Increase Physical Activity
Moving from 'lightly active' to 'moderately active' could reduce your risk by 3%. This is your biggest opportunity for improvement.

Evidence: Regular moderate exercise reduces cardiovascular risk by 20-35% (American Heart Association, 2021)"

### Educational Content

#### Risk Factor Explanations
**Age:**
"Cardiovascular risk naturally increases with age due to changes in blood vessels and heart muscle over time."

**Physical Activity:**
"Regular exercise strengthens the heart muscle, improves blood flow, and helps control other risk factors like blood pressure and cholesterol."

**Diet Quality:**
"Mediterranean-style diets rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events by up to 30%."

**Family History:**
"Genetics account for approximately 40-60% of cardiovascular risk, but lifestyle choices can significantly influence how genes are expressed."
